# Air Quality PDF Estimation using GAN (India Dataset)

This project demonstrates how **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** can be used to estimate the **probability density function (PDF)** of real-world air pollution data.

We use the **India Air Quality Dataset** from Kaggle and apply GAN-based learning to generate synthetic pollutant distributions.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is:

- To collect real NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) pollution values  
- Normalize the data  
- Create noisy observations using user-defined parameters  
- Train a GAN model to learn the density distribution  
- Compare **Real Data PDF vs GAN Generated PDF**

## 🧠 GAN Architecture

### Generator Network
- Input: Random noise
- Output: Synthetic pollutant values

### Discriminator Network
- Input: Real or Fake values
- Output: Probability of being real

Both networks compete during training to improve generation quality.

## 🔑 UID Based Parameters

The project generates parameters based on the UID:

```python
UID = 102303973

A_VAL = 0.5 * (UID % 7)
B_VAL = 0.3 * (UID % 5 + 1)
